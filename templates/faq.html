<button class="accordion">What is corona virus?</button>
<div class="panel">
  <p>Corona viruses are a large family of viruses which may cause illness
	in animals or humans. In humans, several coronaviruses are known
	to cause respiratory infections ranging from the common cold to more
	severe diseases such as Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS)
	and Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS). The most recently
	discovered coronavirus causes coronavirus disease COVID-19.</p>
</div>

<button class="accordion">What is COVID-19?</button>
<div class="panel">
  <p>COVID-19 is the infectious disease caused by the most recently
	discovered corona virus. This new virus and disease were unknown
	before the outbreak began in Wuhan, China, in December 2019.</p>
</div>

<button class="accordion">What are the symptoms of COVID-19?</button>
<div class="panel">
  <p>The most common symptoms of COVID-19 are fever, tiredness, and
	dry cough. Some patients may have aches and pains, nasal
	congestion, runny nose, sore throat or diarrhea. These symptoms are
	usually mild and begin gradually. Some people become infected but
	don’t develop any symptoms and don't feel unwell. Most people
	(about 80%) recover from the disease without needing special
	treatment. Around 1 out of every 6 people who gets COVID-19
	becomes seriously ill and develops difficulty breathing. Older people,
	and those with underlying medical problems like high blood pressure,
	heart problems or diabetes, are more likely to develop serious illness.
	People with fever, cough and difficulty breathing should seek medical
	attention.</p>
</div>
<button class="accordion">How does COVID-19 spread?</button>
<div class="panel">
  <p>People can catch COVID-19 from others who have the virus. The
	disease can spread from person to person through small droplets from
	the nose or mouth which are spread when a person with COVID-19
	coughs or exhales. These droplets land on objects and surfaces
	around the person. Other people then catch COVID-19 by touching
	these objects or surfaces, then touching their eyes, nose or mouth.
	People can also catch COVID-19 if they breathe in droplets from a
	person with COVID-19 who coughs out or exhales droplets. This is
	why it is important to stay more than 1 meter (3 feet) away from a
	person who is sick.</p>
</div>
<button class="accordion">Can the virus that causes COVID-19 be transmitted through the air?</button>
<div class="panel">
  <p>Studies to date suggest that the virus that causes COVID-19 is mainly
	transmitted through contact with respiratory droplets rather than
	through the air. See previous answer on “How does COVID-19
	spread?”</p>
</div>
<button class="accordion">Can CoVID-19 be caught from a person who has no symptoms?</button>
<div class="panel">
  <p>The main way the disease spreads is through respiratory droplets
	expelled by someone who is coughing. The risk of catching COVID-19
	from someone with no symptoms at all is very low. However, many
	people with COVID-19 experience only mild symptoms. This is
	particularly true at the early stages of the disease. It is therefore
	possible to catch COVID-19 from someone who has, for example, just
	a mild cough and does not feel ill.</p>
